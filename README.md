This repository contains the code and dataset used to identify fraud in credit card transactions.
Supervised learning algorithms were implemented in R for the pupose of this project.

The code is divided into three parts as follows:

Part1) Feature engineering:  Creates about 180 new variables from the existing ones, the code is structured for automation and reuse
Part2) Filtering down to about 20 most relevant variables using KS score and FDR methodology
Part3) Implemeting several Machine learning models to identify the best performing model for Fraud detection.
